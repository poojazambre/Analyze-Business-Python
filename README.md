## Analyze Business - Python Pandas
In this project, I have demonstrated my expertise in Python, specifically with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, to analyze and provide actionable insights from sales data. This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization to solve real-world business problems.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to analyze 12 months worth of sales data from an electronics store and answer key business questions to drive strategic decisions. By utilizing Python's powerful libraries, Pandas and Matplotlib, I was able to clean, process, and visualize the data effectively.

## I start by cleaning data. Tasks during this section include:
Drop NaN values from DataFrame,
Removing rows based on a condition,
Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype),
Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. 

## In this section I explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
What products are most often sold together?
What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?


## To answer these questions I use many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat),
Adding columns,
Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str),
Using the .apply() method,
Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis,
Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results,
Labeling our graphs.
